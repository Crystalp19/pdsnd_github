### Project Title
GIT Hub Project
Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
For this project, I created a workflow to refactor my previous BikeShare project using Git. This involved setting up a repository, improving documentation, refactoring, and merging branches. Additionally, I created a python code to allow a user to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States. Those cities are: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Created an interactive experience in the terminal to present statistics on the data from the cities. This was part of the class Programming for Data Science with Python.

### Files used
README.md, bikeshare.py, .gitignore, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv, and forked from: udacity/pdsnd_github
The files used were bikeshare.py, chiacgo.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv, and readme file.

### Credits
Utilized udacity/pdsnd_github to fork from, and the resources from the Programming for Data Science with Python project.
